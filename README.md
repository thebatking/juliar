##Welcome to *JULIAR *
_Incepted On: 4/12/2015_
#####*JULIAR * was originally a new "web" language written in pure javascript. It is now becoming a "desktop" language as well as we're building new Juliar ->ASM compilers, as well as Juliar suite.
_The Project now has 2 versions. Juliar CORE which is "desktop" version and Juliar which is universal web based. Both run modules_

_Starting from Alpha 5, we use babel to transpile. Our code is much cleaner and easier to modify_

####Why use *JULIAR * ?

- __Functional__ _Unlike C, C++, JAVA etc...Juliar is a functional language, which means that everything is a function!_

- __Fast__ _Multi-processing will be used to keep the code running faster._

- __Easy to Learn__ _Juliar Language is very simple to learn. Even if you don't know much programming, you will be a code hero within hours._

- __Cross Platform__ _Juliar runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, Unix, Android, iOS, and any other system you use._

- __Professional__ _Generate High Quality Website pages, Professional Articles, or Powerful Presentations._

- __LaTex Friendly__ _Juliar has a LaTex library, which allows you to generate LaTex content._

- __Sandbox__ _Juliar runs in a sandbox environment._

- __Write Once__ _No need to rewrite your code as Juliar interpreters and JIT compilers will upkeep it for you._

- __Open Source__ _All Juliar code is interpreted or compiled at run time._

##Getting Started
In order to start coding in Juliar. All you need to do is open index.html.
If you want to integrate it into your own current project, add the following:

	<script src="/path/to/juliar.js"></script>
	<juliar></juliar>

and that's it! You can now write juliar code between 

	<juliar>
	
and

    </juliar>

I've also included an interpreter that can be rendered using 

	<ijuliar></ijuliar>
	
NOTE: You can initiate as many interpreters as you want.
Interpreters are very useful in testing out code.
#####Example:
![Interpreter](http://i1382.photobucket.com/albums/ah274/andreifundrei/simple_zpsvejpkyu2.png)

In order to see the available commands. One can type *commands *  between the juliar tags, and it will render all available commands.
You use *import * command to be able to import more juliar scripts (also known as modules) and therefore you will have access to more commands. Some commands will be "overwritten" when using *import *, in order to restore the function, one can use command *deport *. 

#####Example:

	*add 3 2 *
	*import funny_math *
	*add 3 2 *
	*add 5 6 *
	
Output:

	5
	32 
	56

In order to prevent override. One can *deport * i.e.

	*add 3 2 *
	*import funny_math *
	*add 3 2 *
	*deport funny_math *
	*add 5 6 *
	
Output:

	5
	32 
	11

###Author Comment

_I created this programming language for Julia hence the name of the language juliar.
She has an artistic mind and thus, it's difficult for her to code in language, let alone javascript and css.
This language is simple to use and people with a nonlogical mind will be able to use it quickly and easily.
Juliar can be easily  integrated into other sites simply by using <juliar></juliar> tags.
This language is inspired by BBCode, Python, HTML 3.2, and AngularJS.
If you have an improvement to the language i.e. improved code or a new function please commit it on github 
and I will gladly "pull" your request._
